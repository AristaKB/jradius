Building and installing FreeRADIUS with JRadius support:

- rlm_jradius is now part of the FreeRADIUS CVS tree for version 2.0!

- Download the latest FreeRADIUS server.

    wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/freeradius-1.X.X.tar.gz

- Unpack FreeRADIUS

    tar xzf freeradius-1.X.X.tar.gz
    cd freeradius-1.X.X

- Download the JRadius patch and apply it

    wget http://dev.coova.org/svn/cjradius/freeradius/patch/freeradius-1.X.X.patch
    patch -p1 < freeradius-1.X.X.patch

- Compile and install.

    ./configure
    make
    make install


If upgrading an existing configuration:

- Configure FreeRADIUS with the rlm_jradius module. Below we show bits of
  the FreeRADIUS etc/raddb/radiusd.conf file. We are only showing the
  configurations for JRadius. 

    modules {
       ...
       jradius {
          name      = "example"             # The "Requester" name (a single
	  	      			    # JRadius server can have
					    # multiple "applications")
          primary   = "localhost"           # Uses default port 1814
          secondary = "192.168.0.1"         # Fail-over server
          tertiary  = "192.168.0.1:8002"    # Fail-over server on port 8002
          timeout   = 1                     # Connect Timeout
	  onfail    = NOOP		    # What to do if no JRadius
					    # Server is found. Options are:
					    # FAIL (default), OK, REJECT, NOOP
       }
    }

    authorize {
       ...
       jradius
    }

    post-auth {
       ...
       jradius
       Post-Auth-Type REJECT {             # Use this if you want to
           jradius    	     		   # process AccessReject replies 
       }   				   # from the post-auth handler.
    }

    preacct {
       ...
       jradius
    }

    accounting {
       ...
       jradius
    }

    For the most part, the above configurations are considered to be
    required. Only if your FreeRADIUS server is a proxy server would the
    following also be used:

    pre-proxy {
       ...
       jradius
    }

    post-proxy {
       ...
       jradius
    }

  Just like with any FreeRADIUS module, you can add this to any of the
  FreeRADIUS entry points. It is probably best to add 'jradius' to the
  configurations after all other modules.

- Include the dict/dictionary.jradius dictionary file in your FreeRADIUS
  dictionary configuration. You can just simply copy the contents of dict/
  to your FreeRADIUS dictionary directory for the default FreeRADIUS
  dictionary plus JRadius VSAs.
