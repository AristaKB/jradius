Welcome to JRadius!

JRadius should eventually be able to work with multiple underlying RADIUS
servers, however, currently only FreeRADIUS is supported. 

How to get up and running with JRadius:

- First, you need to compile and configure FreeRADIUS such that it uses
  JRadius. See freeradius/README for further instructions.

- Next, copy the build.properties.template file to build.properties. You
  also probably want to edit this file to suite your environment. See the
  comments in the file.

- Next, you need to be sure you have the required dependencies in the
  java/lib directory. See the shell script java/lib/getJars which will
  download the required jar files (using wget).

- Next, compile the JRadius code. The following command will build
  everything (the base code, the FreeRADIUS dictionary, and some
  generic/sample JRadius Handlers:

    ant dist

- Now you should have both a jradius.jar and a jradius-dictionary.jar in the
  dist/ directory. If you already have FreeRADIUS running with rlm_jradius
  and want to see _something_ work, you can run an example with:

    ant run-example

- JRadius also provides a Java RADIUS client API and a Java program called
  RadClient. A shell script is provided to run RadClient. To use the script,
  create a file containing your attributes, for example:

    echo "User-Name = test"      > radius.pkt
    echo "User-Password = test" >> radius.pkt

  Now, use the following script with arguments of server, shared secret,
  and attributes file:

    bin/radclient localhost sharedsecret radius.pkt

  For more information, see http://jradius.sourceforge.net/radclient.html
