Welcome to JRadius!

How to get up and running with JRadius:

First, you need to compile and configure FreeRADIUS such that it uses
JRadius. Unzip freeradius.zip and see freeradius/README.

Start the JRadius server with the jradius.sh script.

    sh jradius.sh

JRadius also provides a Java RADIUS client API and a Java program called
RadClient. A shell script is provided to run RadClient. To use the script,
create a file containing your attributes, for example:

echo "User-Name = test"      > radius.pkt
echo "User-Password = test" >> radius.pkt

Now, use the following script with arguments of server, shared secret,
and attributes file:

    sh radclient.sh localhost sharedsecret radius.pkt
